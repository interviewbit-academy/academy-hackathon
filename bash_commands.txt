scp: Secure/ SSH copy. Copies from either the local filesystem to a remote filesystem, or vice versa. This will not work if both arguments are on remote systems. The remote system must be specified as user@remote.fqdn:/where/to/put. The user part is optional and only needed if the remote account name doesn’t match the local one. remote.fqdn is the remote machine, the colon afterwards tells scp that you’re giving it a path, and the path tells it where to place the file.
